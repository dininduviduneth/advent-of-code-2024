# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2024 project! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
advent-of-code-2024
│
├── day-01/
│   ├── task-XX.py
│   └── ..
├── day-02/
│   ├── task-XX.py
│   └── ..
├── ...
└── README.md
```

Each day's challenge is contained within its own directory (`day-01`, `day-02`, etc.), and each part of the challenge is implemented in separate Python files (`task-XX.py`).

## How to Run

To run the solutions for a specific day, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the Python scripts. For example, to run the solutions for Day 1:

```sh
cd day-DD
python3 task-XX.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Acknowledgements
